# Sherlock2DGame
This Project is done in a group. The team members include Sanjeev, Me, Yogesh and Ranjan. It is a 2d game where the staging is designed with a platform where the character moves and the camera is fixed to its movement. He is sherlock and he has to guess whether the character coming on his way is a criminal or a good guy. The hints will float on the people's head and for increasing the complexity of the game, small animals will come to him and hurt him. So enjoy.

In order to play the game, download the files in the "sherlock" folder and open the *.html file in the browser. I case it asks to download the unity web player, download it and YOU ARE GOOD TO GO :)
